# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

        ## 1. what is this project ?

this is an image slider to slide your localy stord image. suppose you have 1000 of image on your computer and try to 
        see them but can you see all the images one by one. first open the image and close them and after that open 
        the other image it vary inconvenient way so that is why we ned a app that show our image just one click.
        not only that but all so try to see next image just click next button and see this.and much more stuff are available in this app.

## 2. step of making this app ?

Step A-----> Creat #React+vite app by using npm
```bash
  npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
```
step B----> run your #React+vite app
```bash
